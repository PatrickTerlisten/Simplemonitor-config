# Simplemonitor sample config
This is a sample config for the python-based [Simplemonitor](https://jamesoff.github.io/simplemonitor/). The config is split into two files:

- monitor.ini
- services.ini

The monitor.ini contains the basic monitoring config, like service check interval, alerting, logging etc. The services.ini contains the service checks. The services.ini contains only a small outline of the possible service checks.
